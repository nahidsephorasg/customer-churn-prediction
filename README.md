# Customer Churn Prediction Tracking with MLflow

This project implements a comprehensive customer churn prediction system using seven different machine learning models. The project uses telco customer churn data to predict whether a customer will discontinue their service. We integrate MLflow for experiment tracking, PostgreSQL for metadata storage, and Amazon S3 for artifact storage.
